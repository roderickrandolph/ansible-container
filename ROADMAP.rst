Roadmap for Ansible Container
=============================

The roadmap will be published for all major and minor releases. Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.

0.2.0 is the first release with a published road map. Comments, suggestions and requests to the roadmap are welcome. Our goal in publishing vesion roadmaps is transparency 
and community inclussion.  

A roadmap is the team's *best guess* based on experience and community requests and feedback. There are things that may not be included due to time constraints, lack of community 
maintainers, etc.  And there may be things that get missed, so roadmaps are published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible Container, and as a medium for seeking further 
feedback from the community. 

Ways to submit feedback:

  - `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/ansible-container>`_
  - #ansible-container IRC channel on irc.freenode.net
  - `Open an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_ 
  - Join us at the next `AnsibleFest or RedHat Summit <https://www.ansible.com/blog/topic/ansiblefest>`_ 

0.2.0 Roadmap is open for comment
=================================

We are currently working on release 0.2.0 and targeting an early October delivery. We were late in publishing an official 0.2.0 roadmap, so for now we're leaving it open.
There may not be time to add additional features, but your feedback is still very important. If we can't squeeze something in, we can certainly add it to the next release.
Don't hesitate to share your thoughts.
