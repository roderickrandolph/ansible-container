Roadmaps
========

Each major and minor release will receive a roadmap. Roadmaps will appear here. When a new roadmap is available for comment an announcement will be made on the 
`Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/ansible-container>`_.

A roadmap is the team's *best guess* based on experience and community requests and feedback. There are things that may not be included due to time constraints, lack of community 
maintainers, etc.  And there may be things that get missed, so roadmaps are published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible Container, and as a medium for seeking further 
feedback from the community. 

Ways to submit feedback:

  - `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/ansible-container>`_
  - #ansible-container IRC channel on irc.freenode.net
  - `Open an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_ 
  - Join us at the next `AnsibleFest or RedHat Summit <https://www.ansible.com/blog/topic/ansiblefest>`_
